# Django-project
This project is based on creating simple pet medicine respository system where details of every pet whether vaccinated or not are tracked. The system allows the user to verify his/her details at admin panel and after verification he/she will be able to store pet information in order to be listed in the site.

I assumed this project to integrated with the business needs for a online store managemanet and thus I named it as Wisdompets Medicine Store.
Wisdom Pet Medicine strives to blend the best in traditional and alternative medicine in the diagnosis and treatment of health conditions in companion animals, including dogs, cats, birds, reptiles, rodents, and fish. We apply the latest healthcare technology, along with the wisdom garnered in the centuries old tradition of veterinary medicine, to find the safest and most effective treatments and cures, while maintaining a caring relationship with our patients and their guardians.
